CONSTRAINT PROPAGATION
Constraint Propagation is all about using local constraints in a space (in the case of Sudoku, the constraints of each square) 
to dramatically reduce the search space. As we enforce each constraint, we see how it introduces new constraints for other 
parts of the board that can help us further reduce the number of possibilities. We have an entire lesson devoted to Constraint Propagation 
but let's quickly see some other famous AI problems it helps us solve.
